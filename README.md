# img_classifier_SVM_or_XGBoost

As a part of my Internship Program by SmartKnower.

The code is for classifying image category based on user input.

In this I have used images of DOG and CAT and classified them with the help of

1. Support Vector Classifier

2. XGBoost Classifier

I used both classifier one by one whichever classifier provide better accuracy score that model will be used to predict the output


Here i have used "bing_image_downloader" for creating dataset
